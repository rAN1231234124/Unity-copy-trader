# Chart Extraction Improvements Guide

## üìä Overview of Improvements

The chart extraction system has been completely overhauled to provide better accuracy and reliability when detecting trading levels from chart images.

## üéØ Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Multiple Extraction Strategies**
Instead of using a single complex prompt, the system now uses multiple specialized strategies:

- **Comprehensive Strategy**: Looks for all types of visual elements
- **Box-Focused Strategy**: Specializes in extracting prices from colored rectangles/boxes
- **Line-Focused Strategy**: Focuses on horizontal lines and price axis intersections
- **Annotation-Focused Strategy**: Targets text labels and annotations

The system automatically tries different strategies and selects the best result.

### 2. **Clearer, More Focused Prompts**
The new prompts are:
- Shorter and more direct
- Focused on specific visual elements
- Using bullet points for clarity
- Avoiding overly technical instructions

### 3. **Enhanced Validation Logic**
The validation system now:
- Checks logical price ordering based on trade direction (LONG vs SHORT)
- Validates entry price position relative to SL and TP
- Detects unrealistic price ranges
- Provides specific error messages for debugging

### 4. **Better Visual Element Detection**
The system now specifically looks for:

#### Colored Zones/Boxes
- RED boxes/zones = Stop Loss
- GREEN/TEAL/BLUE boxes = Take Profits
- YELLOW/ORANGE = Entry zones
- Price values INSIDE colored areas

#### Horizontal Lines
- Solid lines with price labels
- Dashed/dotted support/resistance lines
- Price axis intersections

#### Text Annotations
- Labels like "TP1:", "TP2:", "SL:"
- Numbers inside/near colored zones
- Current market price (CMP) indicators

#### Visual Indicators
- Arrows pointing to price levels
- Entry point markers
- Highlighted price values

## üí° Better GPT-4 Vision Prompts

### Core Principles for Chart Analysis Prompts:

1. **Be Visual-First**: Describe what to look for visually, not how to think
2. **Use Simple Language**: Avoid complex trading jargon
3. **Provide Clear Structure**: Use numbered steps and bullet points
4. **Focus on Colors and Shapes**: These are easiest for vision models to identify
5. **Request Specific Output**: Always specify exact JSON format

### Example Effective Prompt Structure:

```
WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
1. [Visual element 1]
2. [Visual element 2]
3. [Visual element 3]

HOW TO EXTRACT:
- [Simple instruction 1]
- [Simple instruction 2]

OUTPUT FORMAT:
{specific JSON structure}
```

## üîß Configuration Tips

### For Best Results:

1. **Ensure Good Image Quality**
   - Charts should be clear and readable
   - Avoid heavily compressed images
   - Include the price axis in the screenshot

2. **Include Key Elements in Screenshots**
   - The right price scale/axis
   - All colored zones/boxes
   - Any text annotations
   - Entry point indicators

3. **Chart Preparation** (for manual testing)
   - Use high contrast colors
   - Make text labels large and clear
   - Avoid overlapping elements
   - Keep background simple

## üìà Validation Rules by Asset Type

### Crypto
- Max range: 50% of base price
- Min range: 0.5% of base price
- Typical risk:reward: 1:3

### Forex
- Max range: 5% of base price
- Min range: 0.01% of base price
- Typical risk:reward: 1:2

### Stocks
- Max range: 20% of base price
- Min range: 0.1% of base price
- Typical risk:reward: 1:2.5

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Testing the Improved Extraction
```bash
python test_improved_extraction.py
```

### Running the Bot with Improved Extraction
```bash
python neil_bot.py
```

The bot will automatically use the improved extraction when processing chart images.

## üîç Debugging Extraction Issues

If extraction is failing:

1. **Check the Logs**: Look for specific extraction strategy attempts
2. **Review Validation Errors**: They indicate what's wrong with the extracted data
3. **Examine Raw Extraction**: The `raw_extraction` field shows what GPT-4 found
4. **Try Different Strategies**: You can modify which strategy is tried first

## üìù Prompt Library Usage

The `chart_prompts_library.py` file contains additional specialized prompts for:
- TradingView charts
- Mobile screenshots
- Professional platforms
- Fibonacci levels
- Support/resistance setups
- Order flow charts
- Range breakouts
- Multi-timeframe displays

You can use these by importing:
```python
from chart_prompts_library import get_prompt_for_scenario

prompt = get_prompt_for_scenario("trading_view_style")
```

## üéØ Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Prices extracted in wrong order
**Solution**: The multi-strategy approach will try different interpretations and validate the order

### Issue: Missing some price levels
**Solution**: The box-focused strategy specifically looks for colored zones that might be missed

### Issue: Wrong decimal places
**Solution**: Enhanced parsing handles various price formats and decimal places

### Issue: Entry price not detected
**Solution**: System now looks for "CMP", arrows, and current price indicators

## üìä Performance Metrics

The improved system provides:
- **Confidence scores** (0-100%) for each extraction
- **Processing time** tracking
- **Validation status** with specific errors
- **Extraction method** used for debugging

## üîÑ Fallback Mechanism

If primary extraction fails:
1. Comprehensive strategy attempted first
2. Falls back to box-focused strategy
3. Then tries line-focused strategy
4. Returns best result with validation warnings

## üí¨ Contact for Issues

If you encounter issues with chart extraction:
1. Save the problematic chart image
2. Note the trade type (LONG/SHORT)
3. Check the extraction logs
4. Test with `test_improved_extraction.py`

The improved system should handle most chart types, but edge cases may still require adjustment of the prompts.

    "btc_precise": "Extract exact BTC price levels from this trading chart.\n\nIMPORTANT: BTC prices are likely in the 100,000+ range (six figures).\n\n1. Look for RED zones/lines - this is the Stop Loss\n   - Should be BELOW current price for LONG trades\n   - Read the exact number, likely 105,000-106,000 range\n\n2. Look for GREEN zones/lines - these are Take Profits\n   - Should be ABOVE current price for LONG trades\n   - TP1: First green level (closest to current)\n   - TP2: Second green level (middle)\n   - TP3: Third green level (furthest)\n   - Likely in 109,000-125,000 range\n\n3. Current/Entry price\n   - Look for arrows, markers, or current price indicator\n   - Likely around 107,000-108,000\n\nBE VERY PRECISE:\n- Read each digit carefully\n- Don't round numbers\n- If you see 105,626.40 write exactly that\n- If you see 109,147.50 write exactly that\n\nReturn exact prices as JSON:\n{\n  \"stop_loss\": [exact number from red zone],\n  \"take_profit_1\": [lowest green zone price],\n  \"take_profit_2\": [middle green zone price],\n  \"take_profit_3\": [highest green zone price],\n  \"entry_price\": [current/entry price]\n}",

Decimal point: Note position\n3. Decimal places: Read each decimal digit\n\nCOMMON MISREADS TO AVOID:\n- 105,626.40 vs 105,626.00 (check last digit)\n- 109,147.50 vs 109,174.50 (check digit order)\n- 112,890.20 vs 112,980.20 (check middle digits)\n\nFor each colored zone:\n- RED = Stop Loss\n- GREEN = Take Profits (ordered low to high)\n- Current price marker = Entry\n\nReturn with exact decimal precision.",
